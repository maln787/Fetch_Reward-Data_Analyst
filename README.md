### Data Sources

We are using three data files namely receipts, users, brand data given to us in the challenge. The data files can be found in Data Folder and metadata about the columns in each of the files are also in Data Folder under metadata file.

### Approach

### i) Understanding the data

To understand the data and the features than can be most useful, I first read the problem statement and learned about the data files and the columns present in it. This helped me understand the problem in more depth and what can help me in building the ER Diagram.

### ii) Cleaning the data


### iii) Entity Relation Diagram
